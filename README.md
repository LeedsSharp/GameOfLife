The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

This project is intended to be used at code dojos, specifically Leeds Sharp, as a starting point for coding one's own version of The Game of Life.
The project contains ONLY a set of failing unit tests that accurately describe the entirety of the game. You are invited to write code that makes these tests pass,
and by doing so you will make the game work. 
A web project has been added to visualise your game logic, to allow you to focus on the core problem.

This project uses the latest .NET technology stack at the point of creation. The web project also makes use of React.js.
So, scratch your beard, and stroke your tatoos and have fun coding.
